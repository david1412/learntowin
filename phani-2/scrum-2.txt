About Scrum Artifacts:
 
Definition:Artifacts defiend by scrum are mainly created to maintain transparency of key information so that every body has the same understanding about the work/project.

In simple words:
Scrum artifacts are elements that help to share important project information with everyone involved.

Scru defines three important artifacts:

1.Product Backlog:
A product backlog is a list of all the things that are required in the product and it is a dynamic and best understood requirements for any changes to be made to the product.
Product backlog owned by the Product Owner (PO) which consists of a lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made
to the product in the future releases.

2.Sprint Backlog:
The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.
The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality.

3.Increment:
The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and all previous Sprints.
At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be Done.
