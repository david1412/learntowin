          What is Git?
Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files,
so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to.
Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source. 
So regardless of whether you write code that only you will see, or work as part of a team, Git will be useful for you.

          Git Commands
1) git branch [-a]           =   List all local branches in repository. With -a: show all branches(with remote).
2) git branch [branch_name]  =   Create new branch, referencing the current HEAD.
3)git checkout [-b][branch_name]=Switch working directory to the specified branch. With -b: Git will
                                 create the specified branch if it does not exist.
4)git merge [from name]      =   Join specified [from name] branch into your current branch (the one
                                 you are on currently).
5)git branch -d [name]       =   Remove selected branch, if it is already merged into any other.
                                 -D instead of -d forces deletion
6)git diff [file]            =  Show changes between working directory and staging area.
7)git diff --staged [file]   =  Shows any changes between the staging area and the repository.
8)git checkout -- [file]     =  Discard changes in working directory. This operation is unrecoverable.
9)git reset [file]           =  Revert your repository to a previous known working state.
10)git commit                =  Create a new commit from changes added to the staging area.
                                The commit must have a message!
