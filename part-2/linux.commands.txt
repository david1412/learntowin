                 What is linux
		              =)Linux is the best-known and most-used open source operating system.
			      As an operating system, Linux is software that sits underneath all of the other software on a computer,
			      receiving requests from those programs and relaying these requests to the computer’s hardware.
                 What is Linux Kernel?
                               =)The architecture of an operating system, the kernel is the most important or heart 
			       of the operating system as it manages the communication between a machine’s hardware and its software.
			       The visibility of kernel’s operation is invisible and so it is not accessible to the end-user.
			       These userspace tools only have GUI file systems, web browsers, and the Bash shell.
