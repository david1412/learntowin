               Scrum artifacts
Let’s start with identifying the three artifacts in scrum. Artifacts are something that we make,
like a tool to solve a problem. In Scrum, these three artifacts are a product backlog, a sprint backlog,
and an increment with your definition of “done”. They are the three constants in a scrum team that we 
continue to revisit and invest in overtime.
 
 1) Product Backlog 
                 is the master list of work that needs to get done maintained by the product owner or product manager.
 This is a dynamic list of features, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that acts as the input for the sprint backlog.
 It is, essentially, the team’s “To Do” list. The product backlog is constantly revisited, re-prioritized and maintained
 by the Product Owner because, as we learn more or as the market changes, items may no longer be relevant or problems may get solved in other ways.

2)Sprint Backlog 
                 is the list of items, user stories, or bug fixes, selected by the development team for implementation
in the current sprint cycle. Before each sprint, in the sprint planning meeting 
the team chooses which items it will work on for the sprint from the product backlog. 
A sprint backlog may be flexible and can evolve during a sprint. However, 
the fundamental sprint goal – what the team wants to achieve from the current sprint 

3)incremennts
                an Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of 
the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be “Done,”
which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s definition of “Done.
The entire point of Scrum is to deliver a "Done" increment
