             Scrum artifacts
                          =)Let’s start with identifying the three artifacts in scrum. Artifacts are something
that we make, like a tool to solve a problem. In Scrum, these three artifacts are a product backlog, a sprint backlog,
and an increment with your definition of “done”. They are the three constants in a scrum team that we continue to revisit and invest in overtime

             #Product Backlog 
                           =)Is the master list of work that needs to get done maintained by the product owner or product manager.
This is a dynamic list of features, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that acts as the input for the sprint backlog. 
It is, essentially, the team’s “To Do” list. The product backlog is constantly revisited, re-prioritized 
maintained by the Product Owner because, as we learn more or as the market changes, 
items may no longer be relevant or problems may get solved in other ways.
             
             Sprint Backlog 
	                   =)Is the list of items, user stories, or bug fixes, selected by the development team for
implementation in the current sprint cycle. Before each sprint, in the sprint planning meeting (which we’ll discuss later in the article) 
the team chooses which items it will work on for the sprint from the product backlog. A sprint backlog may be flexible and 
can evolve during a sprint. However, the fundamental sprint goal – what the team wants to achieve from the current sprint
 
             Increment
	                  =)As described in the Scrum Guide, an Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog item                                                        completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new 
Increment must be “Done,” which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s definition of “Done.” 
An increment is a body of inspectable, "Done" work that supports empiricism at the end of the Sprint.  The increment is a 
step toward a vision or goal.  The increment must be in usable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it.
                  [The entire point of Scrum is to deliver a "Done" increment]
