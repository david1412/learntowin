            What is a Build Tool?
                               =) Build tools are commonly known as programs that automate the process of building an 
 executable application from source code. This building process includes activities like compiling,
 linking, and packaging the code into an executable form. Build automation involves scripting or automating 
 a wide range of tasks that software developers perform in their daily activities. 

             The activities includ
	   #Downloading the dependencies.
           #Compiling source code to the form of binary code.
           #Packaging that binary code.
           #Running the tests.
           #Deploying them to the production systems
           #Creating the documents or release the notes
