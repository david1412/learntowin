            Why a Version Control System like Git is needed
                                                    =)Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel.                                            So a version control system like Git is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts between the developers.
Additionally, the requirements in such projects change often.
So a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code.
Finally, sometimes several projects which are being run in parallel involve the same codebase. In such a case, 
the concept of branching in Git is very important.

           Here are some git commands
1) Show the state of the current directory (list staged, unstaged, and untracked files):
                      [git status]
2)List the commit history of the current branch:
                      [git log]
3)List all commits from all branches:
                      [git log --all]
4)Compare two branches by showing which commits from the first branch are missing from the second branch:
                      git log [branch1]..[branch2]
5)Examine the difference between the working directory and the index:
                      [git diff]
6)Delete a local branch:
                      git branch -d [branch]
7)Rename a branch you are currently working in:
                      git branch -m [new_branch_name]
8)Merge the specified branch with the current branch:
                      git merge [branch]
9)Undo changes in a file or directory and create a new commit:
                      git revert [file/directory]
10)Unstage a file without overwriting changes:
                      git reset [file]
