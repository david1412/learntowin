What is Scrum?
>>In simple words Scrum is a lightweight yet incredibly powerful set of values, principles and practices.

Definition of Scrum:
An[agile] framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

Difference Between Scrum & Agile:

The difference between agile and Scrum is that agile refers to a set of principles and values shared by several methodologies, processes and practices; Scrum is one of several agile frameworks--and is the most popular.

Benefits of Using Scrum:
   
As Scrum teams are continuously creating only the highest priority chunks of functionality, the business is assured maximum return on investment.


Scrum helps businesses:

             * Innovate faster
             * Move from idea to delivery more quickly
             * Drive higher customer satisfaction
             * Increase employee morale


Scrum defines three roles

1.PRODUCT OWNER : 
    
The Product Owner defines the what--as in what the product will look like and what features it should contain. 
The Product Owner is expected to incorporate stakeholder feedback to create the highest value product increments each and every sprint.
Product Owners maintain the product backlog and ensures that everyone knows the priorities.

Role of Product Owner :
* Clearly express product backlog items;
* Order the items in the product backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
* Optimize the value of the work the development team performs;
* Ensure that the product backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; 
* Ensure the development team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.

2.SCRUM MASTER :
       
The ScrumMaster helps the Scrum Team perform at their highest level. They also protect the team from both internal and external distractions.
ScrumMasters hold the Scrum Team accountable to their working agreements, Scrum values, and to the Scrum framework itself.


SCRUMMASTER ATTRIBUTES
* Humble. Credits the team, not themselves.
* Respectful. Treat others as whole, creative, and purposeful beings with positive intent.
* Empathetic. Listens to understand. Is comfortable with silence.
* Persuasive. Works to remove impediments throughout the organization.
* Connected. Knows who to talk to (or finds out) to solve problems and resolve issues.

SCRUMMASTER FUNCTIONS
* Coach: Facilitates meetings, conversations, and improvements.
* Protector: Runs interference so the team can remain focused.
* Servant Leader. Leads without authority and puts the team first. 
* Agile Advocate: Reinforces agile principles throughout the organization

3. DEVELOPMENT TEAM :
The Development Team decides how to accomplish the work set forth by the Product Owner. Development Teams are structured and empowered to organize and
manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimizes overall efficiency and effectiveness. 

Development teams have the following characteristics :
* They are self-organizing. No one (not even the ScrumMaster) tells the development team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality.
* Development teams are cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment.
* Scrum recognizes no titles for development team members, regardless of the work being performed by the person.
* Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the development team, regardless of domains that need to be addressed like testing, architecture, operations, or business analysis.
* Individual development team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the development team as a whole.

Development Team Size :
The ideal size for a development is between 3 and 9 people, not including the ScrumMaster and product owner. Any smaller and the team couldn’t accomplish enough each sprint. 
Any larger and communication becomes complex and cumbersome.

SCRUM EVENTS:
Prescribed events are created by Product Manger to keep reqularity and to minimize the need for meetings.

It consists of
1.SPRINT : Scrum Teams work in short timeframes called sprints. Sprints can be as short as one week or as long as one month.Sprints happen one right after the other, with no breaks, to maintain a steady project cadence.Each sprint begins with a plan and ends with a review of the work completed and an additional review of the way in which the team worked together.

2.SPRINT PLANNING : The entire Scrum Team collaborates and discusses the desired high-priority work for the Sprint and defines the Sprint Goal. The ScrumMaster’s role is primarily to facilitate the meeting.The Product Owner describes the objective of the Sprint and also answers questions from the Development Team about execution and acceptance criteria / criteria of satisfaction.The development team has the final say in how much of the high-priority work it can accomplish during the Sprint.
		      
3.DAILY SCRUM : The Development Team meets for 15 minutes or less, every day of the Sprint to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal.They describe for each other how their own work is going, ask for help when needed, and consider whether they are still on track to meet the Sprint Goal.This is not a status meeting but is instead an opportunity for the Development Team to inspect and adapt the product and process on a daily basis.
		      
4.SPRINT REVIEW : Sprint reviews focus on the product being development, specifically on the potentially shippable product increment created during the sprint. During a sprint review, the Scrum Team invites stakeholders to discuss what was completed during the Sprint. They adapt the Product Backlog as needed based on this feedback. The Product Owner has the option to release any of the completed functionality. 
		      
5.SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE : Sprint retrospectives focus on the process. During a sprint retrospective the Scrum Team discusses what went right and areas for improvement in the Sprint.They make tangible plans for how to improve their own process, tools and relationships.


NOTE : Sprint reviews focus on the product. Sprint Retrospectives focus on the process.  

SCRUM ARTIFACTS:
Artifacts defiend by scrum are mainly created to maintain transparency of key information so that every body has the same understanding about the work/project.

It consists of

1. PRODUCT BLOCKLOG : The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in a product. It is constantly evolving and is never complete.
2. SPRINT BACKLOG   : The Sprint Backlog is a list of everything that the team commits to achieve in a given Sprint. Once created, no one can add to the Sprint Backlog except the Development Team. 
3. INCREMENT : A series of small improvements to an existing product or product line that usually helps maintain or improve its competitive position over time.
